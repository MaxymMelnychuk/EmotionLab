# 🎭 Emotion Lab – Creative Frontend Project

## 📖 Description

**Emotion Lab** is a **creative frontend project** developed by **Maxym Melnychuk** and **Rayane Laidi**.  
The goal of this project was to **explore and represent human emotions** through short interactive sections, using creative visual and interactive approaches.

The project focuses on making users **see, feel, and experience emotions** in a short-term format, rather than explaining them theoretically.

Among the many possible emotions, we chose to work on:
- 😨 **Fear**
- 😢 **Sadness**
- 😊 **Joy**

Each emotion is represented through its own section with a distinct atmosphere, interactions, and visual identity.



## 🎯 Project Goals

- Represent emotions in a **creative and visual way**
- Create short interactive experiences for each emotion
- Experiment with frontend interactions and animations
- Improve teamwork and frontend architecture skills

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
